Non-exhaustive wishlist of tweaks to add in future versions...

* Embed scripts/files into the CloudFormation template, no longer need to pull the install script from my S3 bucket.

* Make the ECR Auto-Auth patch (and other patches) optional when deploying/updating the CloudFormation template.

* Adding/removing Proxy and Worker nodes optionally updates Route53 A records.
  * Sometimes we just want to easily get to any master node or any swarm node.
  * Likely based on or using https://github.com/30mhz/autoscaling-route53-lambda?

* Configurable ELB/ELBv2
  * Disable load balancer(s) entirely
    * DNS straight to the nodes, and make use of the Docker Swarm mesh instead
  * More flexibility
    * Internal / External / Internal and External
    * Classing / Application LB / Network LB
