# Docker for AWS CloudFormation Template Tweaker

A program that tweaks [Docker for AWS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/) CloudFormation templates to include missing/useful functionality.  This has been implemented as a script, rather than a set of patches, to work across the different editions/channels/versions of the [Docker for AWS](https://docks.docker.com/docker-for-aws/).

The modifications have been verified with the community edition, stable channel versions between 17.09.0-ce-aws1 and 18.03.0-ce-aws-1 with the "build-a-VPC" option.  Although currently unconfirmed, it is very likely that the edge and enterprise channels, the "don't-build-a-VPC" option, and other versions will also work.

## Features

Enhances Docker for AWS templates with the following features...

* ECR Auto-Authentication - Jake Buchholz

  * Adds AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) policies for Docker Swarm access.
    * separate policies for Manager and Worker nodes
    * selectable policy types, `pull-only` (default), `push-pull`, and `unspecified` (left up to other IAM policies)
    * applicable to all owned registries, or for specific lists of ECR ARNs

  * Refreshes and caches ECR credentials for the Docker Swarm.
    * addresses the issue discussed at https://github.com/docker/for-aws/issues/5 -- without a refresh, the credentials for any Docker service from an ECR would expire after 12 hours, preventing any non-assisted orchestration of that service
    * installs a `refresh-ecr-auth` script on Manager node [Moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) instances, which runs once when a Manager node is instantiated, and then every 8 hours via cron
    * configurable to allow credential caching for ECR in multiple regions and multiple AWS Accounts (defaults to current region, current account)

* Amazon Certifcate Manager (ACM) policies - Jake Buchholz

  * separate policies for Manager and Worker nodes
  * selectable policy types, `read-only` (default), `full-access`, and `unspecified` (left up to other IAM policies)
  * applicable to all owned certificates, or for specific lists of ACM certificate ARNs
